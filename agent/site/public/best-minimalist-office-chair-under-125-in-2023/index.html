Chairs in this range often feature advanced lumbar support and premium materials. For those who are open to spending a bit more, we suggest looking at options like the <strong>Herman Miller Sayl Chair</strong>, which, although over the budget, is a fantastic investment for long-term comfort and support.</p>
