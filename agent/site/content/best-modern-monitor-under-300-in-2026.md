## Buying Guide with Tips

When selecting a monitor, consider the following factors to ensure you make the best choice for your home office:

1. **Screen Size**: Assess your workspace and determine an appropriate size. Larger screens can enhance productivity but require more desk space.
2. **Resolution**: Higher resolutions provide sharper images. For general use, Full HD is sufficient; however, QHD or 4K is ideal for graphic design or gaming.
3. **Panel Type**: IPS panels offer better color accuracy and viewing angles, while TN panels are often cheaper but sacrifice quality.
4. **Connectivity**: Check for compatibility with your devices. HDMI and DisplayPort are standard; USB-C may offer added convenience.
5. **Ergonomics**: Look for adjustable stands that allow you to change height, tilt, and swivel to maintain comfort during long hours.
