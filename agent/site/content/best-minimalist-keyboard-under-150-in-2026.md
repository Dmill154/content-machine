## Buying Guide with Tips

When choosing a minimalist keyboard, consider the following:

1. **Key Switch Type**: Decide between mechanical, membrane, or scissor-switch keyboards. Mechanical keyboards offer a tactile feel, while membrane keyboards are quieter and more affordable.
   
2. **Size and Layout**: Opt for a compact layout if space is limited. Consider whether you need a numeric keypad or extra function keys.

3. **Connectivity**: Wireless keyboards offer more flexibility, but ensure you check battery life. Wired options typically provide lower latency and require no charging.

4. **Build Quality**: Look for durable materials that can withstand daily use. A heavier keyboard may stay put better on your desk.

5. **Ergonomics**: Consider keyboards with a comfortable design that minimizes wrist strain, especially if you type for extended periods.
