## Buying Guide: How to Choose the Best Budget Monitor

When searching for a budget monitor, consider the following factors:

1. **Resolution:** Most budget monitors offer Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution, which is adequate for general use. If you need higher resolution for design work or gaming, look for monitors with 1440p or 4K options, though they might be pricier.

2. **Panel Type:** IPS panels provide better color accuracy and viewing angles than TN panels, making them ideal for creative work. VA panels offer better contrast but can be slower in response times.

3. **Size:** Choose a size that fits your workspace and meets your needs. Monitors between 21-27 inches are generally ideal for most users.

4. **Connectivity:** Ensure the monitor has the necessary ports (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA) to connect to your devices. USB ports can also be a plus.

5. **Adjustability:** Look for monitors with height, tilt, and swivel adjustments for ergonomic comfort.

6. **Eye Care Features:** Consider monitors with flicker-free technology and blue light filters if you plan to use them for extended periods.
