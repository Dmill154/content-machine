## FAQ Section

### What is the difference between IPS and TN panels?
IPS (In-Plane Switching) panels generally offer better color reproduction and wider viewing angles compared to TN (Twisted Nematic) panels, which are typically faster and cheaper but have poorer visual quality.

### Can I use a budget monitor for gaming?
Yes, many budget monitors can handle casual gaming, especially those with IPS panels and low response times. However, high-end gaming may benefit more from dedicated gaming monitors.

### Is it possible to connect multiple monitors on a budget?
Yes, you can use budget monitors to set up a multi-display configuration. Just ensure your graphics card supports multiple outputs.

### Are built-in speakers worth it?
While built-in speakers can be convenient, they often lack quality. For better sound, consider investing in external speakers or headphones.
