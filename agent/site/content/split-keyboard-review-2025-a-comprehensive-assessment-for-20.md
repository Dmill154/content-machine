This review is aimed at professionals, gamers, and anyone who spends extended periods at their keyboard and is looking to improve both comfort and productivity. The split keyboard design aims to alleviate strain on the hands, wrists, and arms, making it an essential piece of equipment for anyone serious about their workspace setup.

## Design and Build Quality

The split keyboard we are reviewing comes with a sleek and modern design that prioritizes ergonomics. The keyboard is divided into two halves, allowing users to position each section at a comfortable angle. This design reduces the strain that typically accompanies typing on a conventional keyboard.

### Materials and Aesthetics

Constructed from high-quality plastic with a matte finish, the keyboard feels sturdy yet lightweight. The keys are made from durable materials that withstand heavy usage without showing signs of wear. The aesthetic is minimalistic, available in several color options to suit different tastes. The compact size also makes it an excellent choice for those with limited desk space.

### Adjustability

One of the standout features is adjustable tenting options. Users can elevate the center of the keyboard to further enhance ergonomics, reducing wrist extension and promoting a more natural hand position. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who have previously experienced discomfort while typing.

## Features Breakdown

### Key Customization

The split keyboard offers extensive key customization options, allowing users to assign different functions to each key. This is especially useful for professionals who rely on shortcuts in software applications. A robust software suite accompanies the keyboard, making it easy to set up and save multiple profiles.

### Connectivity

Equipped with both wired and wireless connectivity, the keyboard offers flexibility. The Bluetooth option is particularly appealing for users who want to declutter their workspace. With a wireless range of up to 30 feet, it is perfect for those who might want to work from a distance.

### Battery Life

While the wireless models provide convenience, the battery life is a concern. Users can expect about 30 hours of continuous usage before needing a recharge. This may not be sufficient for those who forget to charge frequently, so having a backup wired option can be a lifesaver.

### Backlighting

The keyboard features customizable RGB backlighting, which not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also improves visibility in low-light environments. Users can select from various lighting modes and colors, tailoring the experience to their preferences.

## Performance in Real Use

Having tested the split keyboard extensively in various scenarios, it is clear that performance largely depends on user adaptation. 

### Typing Experience

For seasoned typists, the transition to a split keyboard may initially feel awkward, but the ergonomic benefits are noticeable. The keys provide a satisfying tactile feedback, and the layout encourages a more natural hand position. After a brief adjustment period, many users report a significant reduction in fatigue, even after long hours of typing.

### Gaming Performance

Gamers will find that the split keyboard performs admirably, especially in genres that demand rapid key presses. The customizable macro keys allow for quick command inputs, providing an edge in competitive situations. However, some gamers might miss the compactness of traditional gaming keyboards, which often include dedicated gaming features.

### Office Use

In an office setting, the split keyboard excels. The reduced strain on wrists and forearms makes it a favorable option for professionals who spend most of their day in front of a screen. The customizable features also allow users to set up shortcuts that streamline workflows, increasing overall productivity.

## Value for Money Analysis

At a price point that hovers around the mid to high range of keyboards, the split keyboard offers compelling value for those prioritizing ergonomics and customization. While the upfront cost may deter budget-conscious consumers, the long-term benefits—reduced discomfort and increased productivity—can justify the investment. 

Comparison with traditional keyboards reveals that the split keyboard may lead to fewer health-related issues, potentially saving users costly medical expenses in the future.

## Comparison with Alternatives

In the crowded keyboard market, several alternatives challenge the split keyboard's appeal:

1. **Logitech Ergo K860**: Known for its innovative design and impressive ergonomics, the Logitech Ergo K860 offers a similar split layout but with a built-in wrist rest. It has received accolades for comfort but lacks some of the customization features.

2. **Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard**: This model features a more pronounced split and a cushioned palm rest. While it is well-built, some users find it bulky and less portable than other options.

3. **Kinesis Freestyle2**: This keyboard emphasizes adjustability with its split design. The Freestyle2 is lightweight and portable but lacks the advanced features found in more modern counterparts.

Each alternative has its strengths and weaknesses, making it essential for users to assess their specific needs and preferences before making a decision.

## Final Verdict with Recommendation

The split keyboard reviewed here delivers on its promise of enhanced ergonomics and customization. While there is a learning curve for new users, the long-term benefits in comfort and productivity are undeniable. For those who spend significant time typing, this keyboard can be a game-changer.

I recommend the split keyboard for professionals, gamers, and anyone who prioritizes comfort in their workspace setup. While it may not be the most budget-friendly option, the investment is worth considering for improved health and productivity in the long run.
