## Features Breakdown

When evaluating desk drawer organizers, consider the following features:

### Adjustable Compartments
Many organizers offer adjustable dividers that allow you to customize the space according to the items you store. This is particularly useful for users with varying item sizes.

### Non-Slip Base
A non-slip base ensures that the organizer stays in place even when you open and close your drawer. This small feature can significantly enhance usability.

### Stackable Options
For those with limited drawer space, stackable organizers allow you to make the most out of vertical space. This feature is especially beneficial for students or professionals with smaller desks.

### Accessibility
Consider how easy it is to access your items. Organizers with open compartments make it easy to grab what you need quickly, while drawer-style organizers may require more effort to access their contents.
